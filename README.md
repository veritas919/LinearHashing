# LinearHashing

Linear Hashing implementation. Consists of LinearHashing class (lh.py), LinearHashingStats class (lh_stats.py), and a test_set_generator.py module.

A few examples of how to use these modules can be found in the linear_hashing/examples folder. 

First, clone the repository and open the cloned repository (linear_hashing).
You should then set up (and activate) a virtual environment and install the requirements.

Next, navigate to the linear_hashing package. 

"cd linear_hashing" 

Your file path should now look like "whatever_else\linear_hashing\linear_hashing"

Then, run "python -m examples.runner_1" 
Similarly, you can run "python -m examples.skewed_data_testing" 

You can run any of the 4 scripts in the examples folder or even create your own.
